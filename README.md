# Introduction

This is an example of a monte-carlo random walk Monte Carlo simulation of COVID-19. Our goal is to recreate the findings of this (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2021.126014) paper, as well as improve upon it.



# How to use Model

Parameters to change:

STARTING_POPULATION: Change the number of people in the simulation
SIMULATION_ITERATIONS: Change the number of 'days' in our simulation. In our case, 1 loop is 1 day


GRID: This is how big of an area there is to cover. (total area is GRID^2)

You can also type run(), and recreate simulation 1 from the origonal paper
