## Introduction

# Motivation:

  A few short years ago the Covid-19 epidemic broke out--infecting and killing millions of people. This devastating virus has continued to persist among our societies in the form of other variants such as Alpha, Beta. Delta, Gamma, and Omnicron. Since the onset, there have been several variants that differ in the level of contagiousness. This level of contagiousness is known as $R_0$, the number of secondary infections that result from one infected person. For instance, in the early stages of Covid-19, scientists estimated the $R_0$ value to be between 2.24 and 3.58, which means that for every one person infected, 2.24 to 3.58 people were infected from them. This is a way for scientists to measure the spread of the virus in a universal value. Not only can this value tell us about how contagious a disease is, but it can also tell us if a disease is likely to cause an epidemic or not. In fact, for a disease to become an epidemic, the $R_0$ value has to be greater than 1. Given that previous studies have explored the spread and level of contagiousness at the onset of Covid-19, is it important to get a better understanding of Covid-19 in 2022 and what that might look like with data from places like New York and Colorado.   
  
# About the Study
The study we are interested in is called "A random walk Monte Carlo simulation study of COVID-19-like infection spread. Although this study was published in April, 2021, it was finalized and set to publishers in July, 202. Because relatively little was known about Covid at the time, there was not much information about Covid. The purpose of the study is to use parameters they did know about covid, like $R_0$ values, and simulate the spread of the disease. Once they built the simulation, they ran many different types of experiments to better understand how the disease might spread. To run their simulation, they used what is known as a random walk. A random walk is a way to simulate interacting with agents, or people. A random walk is a process in which an agent takes random steps in a direction, determined by a random variable. Lastly, there is a boundary, meaning the agents cannot walk past a certain limit. In this study, this was square by nature, but could realistically be any shape. Through the random walk, the scientists can simulate and estimate the spread of Covid, because Covid is transmissible through infected people coming into contact with non infected people. When the simulation starts, there is one infected person and 9,999 uninfected people. As a trial run, each person is 100% susceptible, meaning that if they come close enough (0.02) meters, then they have a 100% chance of getting infected. The infected person is placed at the middle of the square, and as time goes on the infection slowly spreads outward. This paper can be split into two distinct parts. The first part of the paper shows how covid could spread when they artificially change parameters like population size, how fast the agents can move and reinfection rate. The second part of the paper takes real life populations, and predicts how covid can spread in real world cities. The key takeaways from the first part is that as agents walk faster (or move more freely without covid restrictions), the rate of infection spreads faster. However, as the agents walk slower (or have more covid restrictions imposed on them), infection rates flatten out, and it takes longer for the infection to spread. Lastly, they were interested to see how reinfection plays a part in the continuing of Covid, with a 5% chance of being susceptible to reinfection. From visual inspection alone, it seems that reinfection does increase the number of Covid cases, although not by much. Another reason for this is that they only ran 300 time steps, and so if they ran the simulation longer the results may have been different.
