## Introduction to Paper

-   We investigated the paper "A random walk Monte Carlo simulation of COVID-19-like infection spread"

-   Paper submitted 2 July, 2020

-   Used early Covid-19 data to predict the spread of Covid

## Lack of Data

-   Paper finished early in the pandemic

-   Little was known about Covid-19 in July

## Random Walk


- A random walk is a process that describes a path of succession in space 

- Use previous , position of the person and a random variable to move the person

- We can use this movement to graph interactions between people


```{r, echo=FALSE, width = "50%"}

knitr::include_graphics("gif.gif", dpi = NULL)

```


## Model Overview

- Set patient 0 at the center of the population

- Used a random walk for each person

- If a healthy person is within 2 meters of an infected person, they got infected



## Their Model Results

- This is a model of the infection spread of New York City

  - Each dot represents a person
  
  - Dots are close together to represent a dense urban area
  
- We can think of the time step as a day



```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("their_model.jpg")
```



## Our Recreation


- Although we do not have the exact same code, and are the paper did not publish their set seed

- We are able to get a similar pattern

- Were not able to use as many people because of computational limitations

```{r,fig.keep = 'last', echo = FALSE, results='hide'}


run(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 10, GRID, use = FALSE, p = FALSE)


```

```{r,fig.keep = 'last', echo = FALSE, results='hide'}


run(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 25, GRID, use = FALSE, p = FALSE)

```
```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}

plot_both <- function(tempdf){
  tit = paste("Random Walk of COVID-19 infection spread (", length(recover),  " days)")
  a = ggplot(tempdf)+
    geom_line(aes(x=1:length(recover),y = recover, color = "With Recovery"))+
    geom_point(aes(x=1:length(recover),y = recover), color = "red")+
    geom_line(aes(x = 1:length(recover), y = no_recover,color = "Without Recovery"))+
    geom_point(aes(x = 1:length(recover), y = no_recover), color = "blue")+
    labs(title = tit, x = "Days", y = "Number Infections", color = c("recover", "not recover"))

  return(a)
}
```

```{r,fig.keep = 'last', echo = FALSE, results='hide'}

run(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 50, GRID, use = FALSE, p = FALSE)

```




## COVID-19 Infections with Recovery

- Original Paper did not have any recoveries

- We assumed each person would recover after 11 days


```{r,fig.keep = 'last', echo = FALSE, results='hide'}

 GRID = 0.8
 set.seed(400)
 no_recover = run(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 25, GRID, use = FALSE, p = TRUE)
 set.seed(400)
 recover = run(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 25, GRID, use = TRUE, p = TRUE)
 tempdf = as.data.frame(no_recover)
 tempdf$recover = recover
 plot_both(tempdf)

```




## Our Model

```{r,fig.keep = 'last', echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
set.seed(400)
no_recover = run(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 50, GRID, use = FALSE, p = TRUE)
set.seed(400)
recover = run(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 50, GRID, use = TRUE, p = TRUE)
tempdf = as.data.frame(no_recover)
tempdf$recover = recover

plot_both(tempdf)


```



```{r,fig.keep = 'last', echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
set.seed(400)
no_recover = run(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 75, GRID, use = FALSE, p = TRUE)
set.seed(400)
recover = run(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 75, GRID, use = TRUE, p = TRUE)
tempdf = as.data.frame(no_recover)
tempdf$recover = recover

plot_both(tempdf)


```

```


## Colorado Real Life Cases

- Using data from Colorado to use parameters like transmission rate and recovery rate. 

- Took an average for transmission rate based on 25 simulations in data.

- Found the transmission rate to be 0.47

- A person recovers every 8 days


```{r}
set.seed(400) 
#colorado stuff
check_infected_co <- function(df, infection_length = 8, prob_infected = 0.47, use = FALSE){

}
```


## Colorado Real Cases

- Use Monte Carlo to compute 180 iterations of the simulation. 

- With a starting population of 1000, we can see the spread of Covid-19.

- Without a recovery rate we see that all of the people become infected around day 125.

- With a recovery rate we see that the spread would eventually stop around day 150.


```{r,fig.keep = 'last'}

 no_recover = run_co(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 180, GRID = 0.8, use = FALSE, p = TRUE)
 set.seed(400)
 recover = run_co(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 180, GRID = 0.8, use = TRUE, p = TRUE)
 codf = as.data.frame(no_recover)
 codf$recover = recover
 plot_both_2(codf)
 
```


## Colorado Data

- There are limitations to the Colorado data considering that we did not implement a vaccination.

- This data was also taken from when Covid-19 was not considered an epidemic anymore.

- Still useful to predict how safety measures could impact the spread of the virus.

- Also helpful when determining the length of infections for the virus.


## Conclusions

- We were able to replicate the study for a random walk with monte carlo simulations and implement a recovery rate.

- From there we used MC simulations to estimate the spread of Covid-19 for other places like New York City and Colorado.

- Our models could be improved further by varying probabilities by age or using social distancing measures, but adding in a recovery rate improves the original study.
