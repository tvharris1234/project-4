DataFrame to keep track of coordinates of each agent

for each agent

move a little

if an infected agent is close to another agent

see if they get infected.




psudeo-code



init vars


start sim loop{

- update people's location
- check to see if infected people are close to non-infected people
- if yes, run probability to see if they are infected
- if no, carry on

}

## A Monte Carlo Simulation of Early Covid-19 Data

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## Introduction to Paper

-   We investigated the paper "A random walk Monte Carlo simulation of COVID-19-like infection spread"

-   Paper submitted 2 July, 2020

-   Used early Covid-19 data to predict the spread of Covid

## Lack of Data

-   Paper finished early in the pandemic
-   Little was known about Covid-19 in July

## Random Walk

-   A random walk is a process that describes a path of succession in space -Use previous , position of the person and a random variable to move the person

-   We can use this movement to graph interactions between people

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("gif.gif")
```

## Model Overview

- Set patient 0 at the center of the population

- Used a random walk for each person

- If a healthy person is within 2 meters of an infected person, they got infected


## Their Model Results

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("their_model.jpg")
```

- This is a model of the infection spread of New York City
  - Each dot represents a person
  - Dots are close together to represent a dense urban area
- We can think of the time step as a day




## Our Recreation


- Although we do not have the exact same code, and are the paper did not publish their set seed

- We are able to get a similar pattern

- Were not able to use as many people because of computational limitations


```{r}


set.seed(400)
STARTING_POPULATION = 1000
SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 25
GRID = 25


run <- function(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 3, GRID = 100){
  df = init_df(STARTING_POPULATION, GRID)
  num_infections = rep(NA, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS)
  
  for (sim_loop in 1:SIMULATION_ITERATIONS){
    df = update_location(df, STARTING_POPULATION, GRID)
    df = check_infected(df)
    num_infections[sim_loop] = sum(df$infected)
  }
  
  tit = paste("Random Walk of COVID-19 infection spread (", sim_loop,  " steps)")
  
  length(df$infected)
  ggplot(df,aes(x=x_coord,y=y_coord,group=infected))+
     geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(infected)))+
  labs(title = tit, x = "X Coordinate", y = "Y Coordinate", color = "Infected")
  
  
  #return(num_infections)
}
```

```{r, fig.align = "left"}
run(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 25, GRID = 25)
```

```{r, fig.align = "left"}
run(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 50, GRID = 25)

```

```{r}

run(STARTING_POPULATION = 1000, SIMULATION_ITERATIONS = 100, GRID = 25)
```
